# RB: Faz 22.6 AgentPC2 First-Install Bootstrap

Status: active bounded-pilot runbook

Scope:
- Issue: platform-k8s-gitops#1768
- Downstream acceptance: platform-agent#208
- Target: AgentPC2 / product device `2f7ad30f-970a-42e7-8af8-08764ae6066f`
- Release: platform-agent `v0.2.13`

## Purpose

AgentPC2 can be online with an older agent that does not advertise `UPDATE_AGENT`.
In that state the product update operation correctly fails with HTTP 422, so
platform-agent#208 cannot be accepted through the normal product update path.

This runbook prepares a bounded first-install package that upgrades AgentPC2 to
the operation-capable release without opening broad inbound management paths.

## Non-Goals

This runbook does not prove:

- platform-agent#208 constrained executor acceptance
- broad MSI/GPO rollout
- production/domain-wide remote support readiness
- inbound SSH, RDP, WinRM, SMB, or RPC acceptance
- TPM or hardware-backed device-key attestation

## Workflow

Run the GitHub Actions workflow:

```text
Faz 22.6.3 AgentPC2 first-install bootstrap
```

Required confirmation input:

```text
PREPARE_AGENTPC2_FIRST_INSTALL_BOOTSTRAP
```

The workflow runs on the staging self-hosted runner and performs:

- immutable release metadata verification for `v0.2.13`
- live broker permit public-key derivation from the staging signer secret
- outbound-only remote bridge configuration generation for
  `remote-bridge-mtls.testai.acik.com:443`
- endpoint-local PowerShell bootstrap generation
- redacted evidence artifact upload
- boundary comments on platform-k8s-gitops#1768 and platform-agent#208

The workflow must not mark #208 as accepted.

## Endpoint-Local Action

After the workflow artifact is available, execute the generated
`agentpc2-first-install-bootstrap.ps1` on AgentPC2 from an elevated PowerShell
session.

The endpoint script writes evidence under:

```text
C:\ProgramData\EndpointAgent\rollout-evidence
```

The endpoint-local script contains no HMAC enrollment token, bearer token,
password, private key, or administrator credential. It contains only the broker
permit public key, which is public verifier material.

## Acceptance Hand-Off

Only after AgentPC2 reports an operation-capable agent version may the normal
platform-agent#208 constrained-executor acceptance workflow run.

The #208 acceptance gate still requires:

- outbound 443 mTLS HELLO evidence
- permit verification evidence
- constrained operation evidence
- negative operation evidence
- audit ledger evidence

If those pass, #208 may receive an acceptance comment and the board may advance.
The first-install bootstrap evidence alone is not sufficient.
